# SEO and Accessibility Enrichment for the Horiseon  Marketing Company.

## The goal of this project was to do the following to the code:
  * replace generic tags with semantic HTML elements
  * ensure the HTML code was written in a logical structure
  * add accessible alt attributes to the img tags
  * ensure heading elements are in a sequential order
  * finally, write a clear and consise title
 
These tasks were to be performed in oder to better optimize the site for search engines; to make the site more accessible; to make the code clean, concise, and more organized than when I was first tasked with it.

## To succeed, I made the following changes to the source code:

  * added a title
  * added alt and title tags to the images
  * replaced div tags with header tags and changed the corresponding CSS
  * within the header tag, to express navigation, I replaced the div tags with nav tags
  * added section tags to the body and separated it into three articles and changed the corresponding CSS
  * added footer tags to the author's details and changed the corresponding CSS
  * added aside tags to the content as it appears on the right side of the UI
  * added figure tags around the hero class to denote a stand alone photo
  * rearranged CSS into a more logical structure and added comments
