SEO and Accessibility Optimization for the Horiseon  Marketing Company.

The goal of this project was to do the following to the code:
  1. replace generic tags with semantic HTML elements.
  2. ensure the HTML code was written in a logical structure
  3. add accessible alt attributes to the img tags
  4. enure heading elements are in a sequential order
  5. finally, write a clear and consise tite
 
These tasks were to be performed in oder to better optimize the site for search engines; to make the site more accessible; to make the code clean, concise, and more organized than when I was first tasked with it.

To succeed, I made the following changes to the source code:

  1. added a title
  2. added alt and title tags to the images
  3. replaced div tags with header tags and changed the corresponding CSS
  4. within the header tag, to express navigation, I replaced the div tags with nav tags
  5. added section tags to the body and separated it into three articles changed the corresponding CSS
  6. added footer tags to the author's details and changed the corresponding CSS
  7. added aside tags to the content as it appears on the right side of the UI/UX
  8. added figure tags around the hero class to denote a stand alone photo
  9. rearranged CSS into a more logical structure and added comments
